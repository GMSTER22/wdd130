    <p>

      Hello guys, my relatives call me Gael, I'm married and live in the state of Maryland, I love watching movies, playing basketball, reading, and learning new technologies.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have a Master's in Economics and now trying to completely transition into tech. I'm pursuing a bachelor in Applied Technology. My love for technology led me to start with the self-taught route thanks to the large amount of information related to the field online, and I was able to land my first job as a junior web developer 4 months ago. I'm excited to learn more, and looking forward to meet my classmates.
